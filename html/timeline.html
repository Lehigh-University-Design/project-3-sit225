                <h1> Ancient Lore</h1>
                <p>Eons ago an ancient civilization, named The Ancients, existed in a similar manner to modern humanity. They lived in a Buddhist-influenced dogmatic society heavily influenced by The Great Cycle. This cycle was viewed as a prison as it was an everlasting pattern of death and rebirth, never allowing a soul to truly leave the world. The Ancients embarked on a quest for transcendence, aiming to break free of this cycle. They identified five fundamental 'natural urges' as obstacles to achieving this higher state of being. These natural urges were violence, lust, material possession/attachment, gluttony, and self-preservation. To overcome these obstacles, the Ancients turned to archaic methods, seeking to rid themselves of attachments and desires.
                <br><br>However, these early attempts proved imperfect, prompting the civilization to explore alternative paths. Deep below the surface in the Depths, the Ancients discovered the Void Sea. The Void Sea was made up of Void Fluid and offered the potential to transcend without relying on traditional methods. However, there was a risk associated with taking the plunge; the possibility of evolving into an Echo. Echoes are eldritch entities who have partially transcended, but are bound due to some strong attachment to the world. These uncertainties lead to the development of Iterators.
                <br><br>Iterators, colossal artificial superintelligences, were tasked with solving the "Great Problem": finding a method of breaking free from the Great Cycle without the use of Void Fluid. These machines were constructed using a combination of organic and synthetic components and were built to stand above the clouds. However, in order for Iterators to keep their components cool and organic components clean, they required an immense amount of water. The Iterators stripped their nearby ecosystems of water and pumped water vapor back into the atmosphere, where it would condense into rain and be used again. Due to the torrential and deadly downpours caused by Iterators, the Ancients built their cities on top of the surface of the Iterators' exterior. 
                <br><br>The civilization of the Ancients vanished and crumbled before the Iterators could unveil the solution to the Great Problem. A monumental movement towards transcendence swept through the population, leading to the abandonment of surface cities, which now stand as silent monuments to a bygone era. Despite the collapse of their creators, the Iterators remained operational, tasked with an enduring command: to persist in their pursuit of transcendence without reliance on Void Fluid. They were entrusted with the solemn duty of guiding lesser beings along the path to the ethereal realm, should the solution ever be discovered.
                <br><br>Yet, there was one important rule that an Iterator could not intentionally disobey; they cannot destroy themselves before finding a solution.</p>
