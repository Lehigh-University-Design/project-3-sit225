                    One of the oldest iterators, nicknamed Big Sis Moon.
                    <br><br>She was beloved by her people who lived in the Luna, a city on top of her structure. Being Five Pebbles' superior, she often guided him and ensured that he was on the right path. However, she ended up being greatly hurt by Five Pebbles.
                    <br><br>Five Pebbles attempted an experiment that required stealing water from Moon. Days without water left her to build of slag in her pipes and caused a great extent of damage to her structure. With no other choice, she forcefully sent a message to Five Pebbles as his superior.
                    <br><br>What she didn't know is that she doomed Five Pebbles in the process of interrupting him.

                    Five Pebbles' mentor, the one responsible delivering him the method to his doomed experiment.
                    <br><br>Seven Red Suns is often delivering messages to Five Pebbles via a creature named Spearmaster. Spearmaster was created for the purpose of travelling far distances and sending messages to other iterators. It was through this method that the pearl that contained the genetic shuffling method would be sent.
                    <br><br>Seven Red Suns thought that Five Pebbles would be responsible with this information, but while talking to No Significant Harrassment he expresses that he regrets his decision.
